# Grammar Checker Backend

## Overview

Your task is to build a backend for a grammar checker using a Language Model (LLM). The backend should be able to receive a text input, process it using the LLM, and return a list of errors found in the text along with their corrections and the type of error.

Use Python and a backend framework of your choice. The backend should expose an API endpoint where text can be uploaded. It returns a list of triplets: wrong sentence, corrected sentence, and type of error.

You can use any LLM of your choice. For instance, [Zephyr 7B](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-alpha) can be run on your own device. It is not particularly important that your approach is highly accurate. A conceptual approach is okay. You can also use OpenAI models but you will have to provide your own API keys.

Make sure to think about the following things

- How will the API be documented?
- How will you test the API? 
- What happens if processing takes long? Can you run the process in the background without blocking the frontend?
- How will you handle errors when the LLM generation fails or is not syntactically correct?
- How do you evaluate your approach? Provide a draft of how your system could be evaluated.
- ... and anything you deem important but is not mentioned here. 

## What's important for us 

- Code Quality: Your code should be clean, easy to understand, and well-documented.
- Error Handling: Your application should be able to handle different types of grammatical errors effectively.
- Performance: Your application should be able to handle long-running requests without blocking the client.
- Choice of Backend Framework and LLM: Your choice of backend framework and LLM should be justified based on the requirements of the task.

## Submission

Please submit your code along with a README file. The README should include:

- Instructions on how to run your code.
- A brief explanation of your design choices and why you made them.
- Any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
- Any future improvements or additions you would make if you had more time.

ðŸ¤— Good luck!
